# Proposal: Scrape Investment Reddit

Scrape investment related subreddits and analyze references to companies and graph the popularity over time of certain stock tickers or popularity across different subreddits. Collect data as subreddit, URL, company references, upvotes/downvotes, image, and post body.

Will scrape the top n posts each day from the top 15 most popular investing related subreddits:
